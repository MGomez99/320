Everything seems to be working fine. The only time I saw an error was:
  munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
When running the code on a linux machine after working on windows. Removed the associated ptr from one my my structs and everything works!
Makefile has easy_run and easy_diff options to run the 3 test inputs and diff them

NOTE: USAGE
  >make
  >./cache-sim [inputfile].txt [outputfile.txt]
There will be a prompt "DONE!" when finished.
